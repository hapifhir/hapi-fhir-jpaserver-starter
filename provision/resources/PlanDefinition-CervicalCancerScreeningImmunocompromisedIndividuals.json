  "purpose": "This CDS identifies individuals for whom cervical cancer screening is indicated. It delivers patient-specific evidence-based screening recommendations based on information in the patient’s health record. It also gathers relevant information in the patient record to display to the clinician as a dashboard in support of care decisions. The dashboard includes information such as evidence of previous pre-cancer or cancerous lesions, previous colposcopies and biopsy results, previous surgeries, etc. The CDS integrates tightly with a companion CDS component (i.e., “Management CDS”), which provides evidence-based care recommendations if screening results are “abnormal”.",
  "usage": "This artifact is intended for use by healthcare personnel working in primary healthcare settings who care for adolescent and adult patients (i.e., physicians, general practitioners, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and obstetricians).",
