The entity playing the role of HealthCareFacility is a place (Place class). The entity scoping the HealthCareFacility role is an organization (Organization class).\n\nThe setting of an encounter (e.g. cardiology clinic, primary care clinic, rehabilitation hospital, skilled nursing facility) can be expressed in HealthCareFacility.code. Note that setting and physical location are not the same. There is a many-to-many relationship between setting and the physical location where care is delivered. Thus, a particular room can provide the location for cardiology clinic one day, and for primary care clinic another day; and cardiology clinic today might be held in one physical location, but in another physical location tomorrow.\n\nWhen the location is an organization, this is indicated by the presence of a scoping Organization, without a playing Place.",
