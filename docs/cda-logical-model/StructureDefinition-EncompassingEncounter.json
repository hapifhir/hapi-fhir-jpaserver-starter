Thus, a particular room can provide the location for cardiology clinic one day, and for primary care clinic another day; and cardiology clinic today might be held in one physical location, but in another physical location tomorrow.\n\nWhen the location is an organization, this is indicated by the presence of a scoping Organization, without a playing Place.",
