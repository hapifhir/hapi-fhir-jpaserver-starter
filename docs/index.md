# Welcome to matchbox documentation

Matchbox is an open source initiative to support testing and implementation of FHIR-based solutions and to map or capture health data into [HL7® FHIR®](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) , 
the standard for healthcare interoperability. See [matchbox.health](https://www.matchbox.health/) for more information.

Matchbox can be deployed as a microservice in your IT infrastructure or used as a standalone java library.
